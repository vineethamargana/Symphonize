DENO:
------
Deno is a secure, modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that comes with built-in TypeScript support,
a standard library, and no dependency on npm.

Node:
-----
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that enables server-side execution of JavaScript, powered by the V8 engine, 
and includes npm for package management.

Advantages of deno:
-------------------
Unlike Node.js, which requires extra tools like TypeScript compilers or Babel for TypeScript, Deno has built-in support for TypeScript. You can run TypeScript code directly without needing any extra configuration.
1. do not need to install TypeScript separately to use Deno. Deno has TypeScript support built-in.
2. Security by Default: Deno runs code in a sandboxed environment, requiring explicit permissions to access files, network, or environment variables (e.g., --allow-net, --allow-read).
3. Modern Features: Supports modern JavaScript features like ES modules (import/export) and top-level await natively.
4. No npm Dependency: Deno fetches and caches dependencies directly from URLs, avoiding a centralized package manager like npm.
5. the seperate js file will not be generated for exceution as javascript file which is mandatory in node.js as we run the .ts file using tsc command it will create a sepearate file for it in javascript which we have to exceute to get result. DENO eliminates this process it will run the typescript files directly with only one command


Installing DENO and running typescript files using DENO:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. install deno :
For Windows:
Using PowerShell: Open PowerShell and run:

iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex


2. check installed or not
deno --version

3. Run your files:
-> create a file using .ts extension and write your logic
-> save and run this command [ deno run filename.ts ] for typescript and [ deno run filename.js ] if we want to run javascript files
-> it will not create a .js file like node (which we have to run to get output ) it directly gives the output.
DENO eliminates the process of creating the .ts files
